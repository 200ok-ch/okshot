* NAME

=okshot= - Take and annotate screenshots in Linux with standard tools.

* SYNOPSIS

  #+begin_example
    Usage: okshot [options]
        -c, --copy-clipboard             Copy PNG file from clipboard and upload
        -i, --inkscape                   Use inkscape to edit the screenshot and upload
  #+end_example

* DESCRIPTION

=okshot= takes a screenshot, saves it to a FTP server and copies a web
accessible URL to your clipboard. Optionally, the screenshot can be
annotated using Inkscape.

This gem is inspired by the lack of good screenshot tooling in Linux.
However, it's so very easy to build =okshot=, because

For uploading the files via FTP, it needs these environment variables set:

- OKSHOT_HOST
- OKSHOT_USER
- OKSHOT_PASSWORD
- OKSHOT_URL_PREFIX

For example, you can do this in your shell config file (=~/.bashrc=,
=~/.zshrc=) or via [[https://200ok.ch/posts/contextual-helpers-with-zsh-hooks.html][sourceme]]. For example:

#+begin_example
export OKSHOT_HOST=ftp.some-server.ch
export OKSHOT_USER=your_user
export OKSHOT_PASSWORD=your_password
export OKSHOT_URL_PREFIX=https://okshot.your_domain.ch
#+end_example

* INSTALLATION

=okshot= is implemented in [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][Ruby]] and can be installed as a [[https://rubygems.org/][gem]].

  #+begin_example
    gem install okshot
  #+end_example

It assumes you're using the [[https://i3wm.org/][i3wm]] tiling window manager and uses these
standard Linux tools:

- [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/wmctrl][wmctrl]]
- [[https://inkscape.org/][inkscape]]
- [[https://imagemagick.org/][imagemagick]]

Install dependencies:

#+begin_src shell
apt-get install imagemagick inkscape wmctrl
#+end_src

* DEVELOPMENT

=okshot= is implemented in [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][Ruby]], dependencies are managed with [[https://bundler.io/][bundler]].

You can also run =bin/console= for an interactive prompt that will
allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run =bundle exec rake
install=. To publish a new version, update the version number in
=version.rb=, and then run =bundle exec rake publish=, which will
create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push
